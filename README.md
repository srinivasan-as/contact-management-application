# Contact Management Application
The Contact Management Application is a powerful and efficient backend system designed to handle the storage and management of contacts for various applications. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for storing, retrieving, and manipulating contact information.

# Features
User Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to the application to manage their contacts securely.\
Contact CRUD Operations: The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing contact information.\
Secure Authentication: User authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their own contact data.\
Flexible Contact Fields: The application allows storing various contact fields such as name, phone number, email address, and additional custom fields to accommodate specific requirements.\
Search and Filter: Users can search and filter their contacts based on different criteria, making it easy to locate specific contacts from their database.
Sorting and Pagination: The application provides sorting and pagination functionality to efficiently manage and display contacts.
Integration Support: It offers integration capabilities with other systems and APIs to import or export contact data from external sources.
Audit Trail: The application tracks and logs all changes made to contact records, ensuring data integrity and accountability.
Robust Security: Security measures such as data encryption, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities are implemented to safeguard contact data.

# API Endpoints

# Security Considerations
To ensure the security of the Contact Management Backend Application, please keep the following points in mind:

Secure JWT Secret: Use a strong and random secret key for JWT token signing and verification. Keep the secret key securely stored and do not expose it (like in .env file).\
Token Expiration: Set an appropriate expiration time for JWT tokens to limit their validity period.\
Token Revocation: Implement token revocation mechanisms such as token blacklisting or token expiry validation to handle logout or account deactivation scenarios.\
Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).\
Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and personal information in transit and at rest.\
Regular Updates: Keep the application and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.\
Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regularly backup the application's database and implement disaster recovery measures to prevent data loss.
